##
## Start your application server with the system property
## "system.properties.load" set to true to load the external file called
## system.properties. This is given as a convenient way to ensure all properties
## are set for deployment. When the server starts, the portal will load
## system.properties and then system-ext.properties.
##
## Start your application server with the system property
## "system.properties.final" set to true if the properties of system.properties
## override all similar command line properties. If set to false, the properties
## of system.properties will be set if and only if those properties are not
## currently set.
##
## Some application servers require you to set the "file.encoding" and
## "user.timezone" on startup regardless of system.properties because the
## application server reads these properties before system.properties is ever
## loaded.

## Java

    # internationalization to work correctly.

    # Java uses the underlying operating system to generate images. If you are
    # using Unix and do not start the portal in a X Windows session, then Java
    # will not know how to generate images and you'll get lots of nasty
    # exceptions. Setting this property to true will fix that. Sometimes this
    # property cannot be set dynamically when the server starts and you'll need
    # to edit your start script to include this as a system property.

## Java Command Properties
##

    #
    # Note, the following system properties are read by Java before the portal's
    # system properties loader is executed. That means modifying the changes
    # here will do nothing. It's simply listed here so all system properties are
    # grouped together. You must modify these values at the Java command level.
    # Below is an example.
    #
    # java ... -Dcom.liferay.portal.kernel.util.ByteArrayMaker.initial.size=8000
    #

    ##
    ## Makers
    ##

        #
        # Use our own StringMaker to extend StringBuffer and ByteArrayMaker to
        # extend ByteArrayOutputStream. This will add analytical tracking of our
        # char and byte usage so we can better optimize memory by minimizing
        # unnecessary garbage collecting that comes from unspecified array
        # growth.
        #
